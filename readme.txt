8. Save and Preview your post to verify that all your links work

All traffic to your blog will be randomly shown 1 of the posts included in your split test and the number of views for each post will be recorded, along with every outbound link click for each post.
7. Once you've determined the most effective post, select it from the End Split Test dropdown, then click the blue 'Choose Preferred Post' button
8. All traffic will now only be shown your Preferred Post

NOTE: The split testing features provided in this plugin will easily help you determine which post has the highest CTR, but if you also want to test which post results in the most sales, the easiest way to do that is by creating a different Alias in your AffiliateWire account for each post. You'll need to add each of those Aliases to the Quick Ignition Plugin through the settings tab, then select a different Alias when creating each version of your blog post. Then use the reporting provided by the Split Testing tab of the Quick Ignition plugin in conjunction with the reporting provided in your AffiliateWire account to determine which post is the most effective.
